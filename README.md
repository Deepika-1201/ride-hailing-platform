# Ride-Hailing Platform

A ride-hailing and dispatch platform built as a real-time distributed system. Riders request rides, drivers stream their live locations, and the platform matches each request to a nearby driver within seconds, then manages the ride through an explicit state machine until the trip ends.

The focus is the real-time layer: ingesting a continuous stream of driver locations, finding nearby drivers while positions change thousands of times a second, and dispatching safely under concurrency, so that a driver is never assigned to two rides at once.

> **Status:** design phase. Done: the requirements baseline, design spikes S-1 to S-3, the high-level design with its three deep dives, and ADR-001 to ADR-018. Next comes the low-level design and the implementation plan. Implementation starts once the design is approved.
